PI
---------
[x] Get project to basic installable
[x] Split up functionality provided by other magic libraries so its easy to break up when we bring it in
[ ] Update README for current config and install
[x] Add testing scripts for generating publish of data
    - would be nice to containerise this so we could just run `make data` and it will spit stuff into Rabbit
    - Later we can roll this into the docker compose and just `make run` to spin up Rabbit, Redis, publisher & PI
[x] Get timed loop working so we can yeet threading
[x] Figure out how to add timers to consume instance so we can use this and port it into mrabbit
[x] Set up Makefile and `docker-compose` to spin up containers for Redis and Rabbit
[ ] Clean up config by using argparse and config file
[ ] Pass config options for containers on startup
[ ] Decide whether we want to publish an empty set of orders on startup, and how we'll handle service restarts.
[ ] Figure out, implement and document the best way to handle the caching.
[ ] Write tests

Rabbit
----
[ ] Implement timers which clients can use to add customer timed callbacks 
[ ] Introduce a max consume window by exiting consume after the timer expires
