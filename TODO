[x] Get project to basic installable
[x] Split up functionality provided by other magic libraries so its easy to break up when we bring it in
[ ] Update README for current config and install
[ ] Add testing scripts for generating publish of data
    - would be nice to containerise this so we could just run `make data` and it will spit stuff into Rabbit
    - Later we can roll this into the docker compose and just `make run` to spin up Rabbit, Redis, publisher & PI
[ ] Get timed loop working so we can yeet threading
[ ] Figure out how to add timers to consume instance so we can use this and port it into mrabbit
[ ] Set up Makefile and `docker-compose` to spin up containers for Redis and Rabbit
[ ] Clean up config by using argparse and config file
[ ] Pass config options for containers on startup
[ ] Figure out a sensible way to auth redis, plus how we can easily do this in containers
    - I have gotten rid of this for now since we're just testing.
    - In QA currently we have a redis instance which just has a password, but it's running on the same host.
    - What would this look like on the PaaS?
[ ] Figure out and document the best way to handle the caching.
[ ] Write tests.
